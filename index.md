# CS184: Computer Graphics and Imaging

Welcome to my CS184 course website! This site contains documentation and results for all homework assignments in the Computer Graphics and Imaging course.

## Course Overview

CS184 covers fundamental concepts in computer graphics, including:

- Rasterization and rendering pipelines
- Geometric transformations
- Lighting and shading models
- Ray tracing and global illumination
- And much more!

## Homework Assignments

### [Homework 1](hw1/)

**Rasterization and Basic Rendering**

This assignment focuses on implementing fundamental rasterization algorithms and basic rendering techniques. The assignment is divided into 6 tasks covering different aspects of the rendering pipeline.

**Tasks:**

- [Task 1](hw1/Task1/) - Basic rasterization concepts
- [Task 2](hw1/Task2/) - Line and triangle drawing
- [Task 3](hw1/Task3/) - Texture mapping
- [Task 4](hw1/Task4/) - Geometric transformations
- [Task 5](hw1/Task5/) - Advanced rendering techniques
- [Task 6](hw1/Task6/) - Final project integration

## About This Site

This site is built using [Jekyll] with the [Just the Docs] theme, providing a clean and organized way to present homework documentation and results. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site _locally_. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.
