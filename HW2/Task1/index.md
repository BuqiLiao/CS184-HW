# Task 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision

## Overview

This task implements 1D de Casteljau subdivision for Bezier curves, allowing for efficient evaluation of Bezier curves at any point along the curve. The implementation supports both interior and boundary points, handling both interior and boundary cases appropriately.

## Implementation
