# Homework 1: Rasterization and Basic Rendering

## Overview

This homework assignment covers fundamental concepts in computer graphics and rasterization. The assignment is divided into 6 tasks, each focusing on different aspects of the rendering pipeline, from basic triangle rasterization to advanced texture mapping with mipmaps.

## Tasks

### [Task 1](Task1/)

**Drawing Single-Color Triangles**

Implement triangle rasterization using point-in-triangle tests with pixel center sampling. The implementation handles triangles regardless of winding order and efficiently samples within the triangle's bounding box.

### [Task 2](Task2/)

**Antialiasing by Supersampling**

Implement supersampling antialiasing by sampling multiple times per pixel and averaging results. The implementation uses a higher-resolution sample buffer and downsamples to the final framebuffer resolution.

### [Task 3](Task3/)

**Transforms**

Implement geometric transformations (translate, scale, rotate) in homogeneous coordinates using 3Ã—3 matrices. These transforms enable hierarchical transformations of SVG objects for complex animations and positioning.

### [Task 4](Task4/)

**Barycentric Coordinates**

Implement barycentric coordinate interpolation for triangles, allowing smooth color blending across triangle surfaces. Colors defined at vertices are interpolated across the entire triangle area.

### [Task 5](Task5/)

**Pixel Sampling for Texture Mapping**

Implement texture mapping using two pixel sampling methods: nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation. The implementation enables rendering triangles with colors sampled from texture images using 2D texture coordinates.

### [Task 6](Task6/)

**Level Sampling with Mipmaps**

Implement mipmap level sampling for texture mapping, supporting three level sampling methods: zero-level, nearest level, and linear level interpolation. This enables adaptive texture resolution based on screen-space derivatives.

## Learning Objectives

- **Triangle Rasterization**: Understand and implement efficient triangle filling algorithms

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core implementation language
- **OpenGL**: Graphics API for rendering
- **CMake**: Build system configuration
- **Jekyll**: Documentation website generation
- **SVG**: Vector graphics format for test cases
- **PNG**: Image format for texture mapping

## Key Concepts Covered

### Rasterization Pipeline

1. **Triangle Setup**: Bounding box calculation and edge function computation
